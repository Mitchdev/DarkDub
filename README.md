## What is FCS ?  
FCS is a script which aims to improve your general experience on dubtrack.fm  
FCS is simple to use, fast to load and available for everyone[**1**].  
*Note to developers: FCS has it's own [API](http://wibla.free.fr/FCS/API.html).*  
  
## How to get FCS ?  
The easiest way to install FCS is adding the chrome extension available [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/french-community-extensio/hhfnamlpappbnebgmifbcnlpjnenekol).  
GreaseMonkey Users, [this](http://wibla.free.fr/FCS/ressources/FCE.user.js) is for you.
  
The second easiest way is with a bookmark:  
```javascript
javascript:(function(){$.getScript('https://rawgit.com/WiBla/FCS/master/ressources/script.js');}());
```
Copy this code onto a new bookmark, click it once in dubtrack and voil√† !  
Enjoy your new way of navigating on dubtrack ;)  
  
## Other Stuff
I update this [page](http://wibla.free.fr/FCS/) often with sneak peak of next features and known bugs.  
  
[**1**] If you want to translate the script in your language:  
Fork the project and pull request a new JSON in [FCS/lang/](https://github.com/WiBla/FCS/tree/master/lang)  
**Make sure you follow the standar syntax by copying an existing JSON file.** (Not ready yet.)
