## What is DarkDub ?  
DarkDub is a script which aims to improve your general experience on dubtrack.fm  
DarkDub is simple to use, fast to load and available for everyone[**1**].  
*Note to developers: DarkDub has it's own [API](http://wibla.free.fr/darkdub/API.html).*  
  
## How to get DarkDub ?  
The easiest way to install DarkDub is adding the chrome extension available [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/darkdub-extension/hhfnamlpappbnebgmifbcnlpjnenekol).  
GreaseMonkey Users, [this](http://wibla.free.fr/darkdub/ressources/FCE.user.js) is for you.
  
The second easiest way is with a bookmark:  
```javascript
javascript:(function(){$.getScript('https://rawgit.com/WiBla/DarkDub/master/ressources/script.js');}());
```
Copy this code onto a new bookmark, click it once in dubtrack and voil√† !  
Enjoy your new way of navigating on dubtrack ;)  
  
## Other Stuff
I update this [page](http://wibla.free.fr/darkdub/) often with sneak peak of next features and known bugs.  
  
[**1**] If you want to translate the script in your language:  
Fork the project and pull request a new JSON in [DarkDub/lang/](https://github.com/WiBla/DarkDub/tree/master/lang)  
**Make sure you follow the standar syntax by copying an existing JSON file.**
